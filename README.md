# ShortcutLister

Adds a notification icon to the Windows System Tray. You can click on this icon to view a list of shortcuts you create.

The shortcuts should be placed in a specific folder (Settings screen can open it). Any shortcuts in that folder will be shown in the popup menu when clicking on the notification icon.
